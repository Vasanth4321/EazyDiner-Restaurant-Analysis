# EazyDiner Restaurant Analysis

## 🍽️ Overview
Comprehensive web scraping and analysis of EazyDiner restaurants in Bengaluru. This project demonstrates end-to-end data science workflow including web scraping, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and advanced visualizations of restaurant attributes, ratings, cuisines, and dining experiences.

## 📊 Project Objectives
- Extract comprehensive restaurant data from EazyDiner Bengaluru
- Clean and validate scraped data for quality assurance
- Perform exploratory data analysis on restaurant characteristics
- Identify patterns in ratings, cuisines, and dining preferences
- Create actionable visualizations for restaurant insights
- Build a replicable data pipeline for restaurant analysis

### Data Processing
- **Python 3.x** - Primary programming language
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** - Numerical computations
- **Regular Expressions** - Text pattern matching and cleaning

### Data Storage
- **CSV files** - Raw and processed datasets

## Recommendations

Data-driven recommendations based on the Bengaluru EazyDiner analysis, tailored for three key stakeholder groups:

### For Restaurant Entrepreneurs

- **Choose a clear specialization** (Italian, Continental, Pan Asian) to differentiate in a crowded casual dining market.
- **Set strategic pricing**: Base price around ₹2,000 with a standard 25% discount to achieve an effective ₹1,500 price point aligned with market expectations.
- **Prioritize operational excellence** and service quality, as small execution gaps quickly show up in ratings and reviews.
- **Target expansion into underserved regions** like North and West Bengaluru where demand is rising but supply lags.
- **Maintain a 4.0+ rating** as a non-negotiable quality bar for long-term brand health and repeat business.

### For Investors and Franchisors

- **Allocate capital to mid-range, specialized concepts**, which represent roughly 84.1% of the market opportunity in this segment.
- **Focus on North and West Bengaluru** as primary growth zones for new outlets and franchise rollouts.
- **Enforce strict quality control** and operational standards, as customer ratings directly influence franchise brand value and unit economics.
- **Avoid premium concepts** unless there is proven luxury brand equity and a clear high-spend customer base.
- **Design comprehensive training programs** that emphasize operational consistency, since ratings improve strongly with repeatable, standardized execution.

### For Customers

- **Higher price does not guarantee better quality**; the analysis shows weak correlation between spend level and rating.
- **Prefer specialized cuisine restaurants**, which deliver higher average satisfaction (around 4.34 vs 4.19 for non-specialized venues).
- **Use a 4.0+ rating** as a practical threshold for reliably good dining experiences.
- **Consider regional patterns**: South and East Bengaluru tend to offer more consistent quality, while North Bengaluru often provides better value for money.
- **Expect standard discounts** around 25% as market norm and verify restaurant participation in these offers.
