## 🍽️ Overview
Comprehensive web scraping and analysis of EazyDiner restaurants in Bengaluru. This project demonstrates end-to-end data science workflow including web scraping, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and advanced visualizations of restaurant attributes, ratings, cuisines, and dining experiences.

## 📊 Project Objectives
- Extract comprehensive restaurant data from EazyDiner Bengaluru
- Clean and validate scraped data for quality assurance
- Perform exploratory data analysis on restaurant characteristics
- Identify patterns in ratings, cuisines, and dining preferences
- Create actionable visualizations for restaurant insights
- Build a replicable data pipeline for restaurant analysis

### Data Processing
- **Python 3.x** - Primary programming language
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** - Numerical computations
- **Regular Expressions** - Text pattern matching and cleaning

### Data Storage
- **CSV files** - Raw and processed datasets

- ## 📈 Key Business Insights - Final Findings

### 🎯 FINDING 1: THE PRICE PARADOX
- **Correlation (Rating vs Cost):** -0.0465
- **Explanation:** Higher price DOES NOT guarantee better ratings
- **Business Impact:** Quality depends on EXECUTION, not price premium
- **Recommendation:** Focus on operational excellence over premium pricing

### 🎯 FINDING 2: MARKET SWEET SPOT VALIDATED
- **Optimal Formula:** ₹2,000 base + 25% discount = ₹1,500 final price
- **Market Adoption:** 32.9% of successful restaurants
- **Market Segmentation:** Mid-range (84.1%) >> Premium (3.8%) >> Budget (12.1%)
- **Recommendation:** Start with ₹2,000 + 25% discount model

### 🎯 FINDING 3: SPECIALIZATION ADVANTAGE
- **Continental:** 4.633 vs Multicuisine: 4.187
- **Advantage:** +0.45 rating points
- **Market Status:** Multicuisine saturated (43.1%), Specialists diverse (56.9%)
- **Recommendation:** Specialize for differentiation and higher ratings

### 🎯 FINDING 4: MARKET MATURITY & QUALITY CONSISTENCY
- **Average Rating:** 4.25/5.0 (High and consistent)
- **Quality Threshold:** 86% of restaurants maintain 4.0+ rating
- **Market Insight:** Quality is table-stake, not competitive advantage
- **Recommendation:** Quality baseline mandatory, differentiate via specialization

### 🎯 FINDING 5: REGIONAL MARKET DYNAMICS
- **South Bengaluru:** Volume leader (24.8% market share)
- **North Bengaluru:** HIGHEST rating (4.36), Growth opportunity (10% share)
- **East Bengaluru:** Quality premium zone (4.35 rating)
- **Central Bengaluru:** Competitive established market
- **Recommendation:** Expansion in North/East zones for growth

### 🎯 FINDING 6: DISCOUNT STRATEGY
- **Correlation (Rating vs Discount):** 0.0451 (Weak)
- **Finding:** Discounts minimal rating impact, but customer expectation
- **Standard:** 25% discount most common (37.5% of market)
- **Recommendation:** Implement 20-25% standard discount, avoid over-discounting


## Recommendations

Data-driven recommendations based on the Bengaluru EazyDiner analysis, tailored for three key stakeholder groups:

### ✨📈 FOR RESTAURANT ENTREPRENEURS:

-  **Choose a clear specialization** (Italian, Continental, Pan Asian) to differentiate in a crowded casual dining market.
-  **Set strategic pricing**: Base price around ₹2,000 with a standard 25% discount to achieve an effective ₹1,500 price point aligned with market expectations.
-  **Prioritize operational excellence** and service quality, as small execution gaps quickly show up in ratings and reviews.
-  **Target expansion into underserved regions** like North and West Bengaluru where demand is rising but supply lags.
-  **Maintain a 4.0+ rating** as a non-negotiable quality bar for long-term brand health and repeat business.

### 💰 For Investors and Franchisors

- **Allocate capital to mid-range, specialized concepts**, which represent roughly 84.1% of the market opportunity in this segment.
- **Focus on North and West Bengaluru** as primary growth zones for new outlets and franchise rollouts.
- **Enforce strict quality control** and operational standards, as customer ratings directly influence franchise brand value and unit economics.
- **Avoid premium concepts** unless there is proven luxury brand equity and a clear high-spend customer base.
- **Design comprehensive training programs** that emphasize operational consistency, since ratings improve strongly with repeatable, standardized execution.

### 🙋 For Customers

- **Higher price does not guarantee better quality**; the analysis shows weak correlation between spend level and rating.
- **Prefer specialized cuisine restaurants**, which deliver higher average satisfaction (around 4.34 vs 4.19 for non-specialized venues).
- **Use a 4.0+ rating** as a practical threshold for reliably good dining experiences.
- **Consider regional patterns**: South and East Bengaluru tend to offer more consistent quality, while North Bengaluru often provides better value for money.
- **Expect standard discounts** around 25% as market norm and verify restaurant participation in these offers.
